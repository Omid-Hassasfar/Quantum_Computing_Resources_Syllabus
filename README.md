Quantum Computing Resources &amp; Syllabus, Mind Map Format, 
1. Resources: curated list of books, courses, videos.
2. Syllabus: visual course overview of key topics.

This repository contains two detailed mind maps designed to assist learners, educators, and self-studiers in the field of Quantum Computing:

Quantum Computing Resources
A curated visual collection of essential learning materials, including lecture notes, textbooks, video lectures, online courses, and tutorials, all organized into a structured format with active hyperlinks for quick and easy access.

Quantum Computing Syllabus
A visual course overview outlining the main topics and concepts typically covered in a foundational or intermediate quantum computing course. This is especially useful for course planning, personal study roadmaps, or onboarding new learners.

This collection is the result of years of hands-on experience and exploration in the quantum field. It goes far beyond simply asking an AI to compile a list!
