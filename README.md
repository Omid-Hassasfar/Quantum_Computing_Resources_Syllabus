# Quantum_Computing_Resources_Syllabus
Quantum Computing Resources &amp; Syllabus, Mind Map Format, 
1. Resources: curated list of books, courses, videos.
2. Syllabus: visual course overview of key topics.

This repository contains two detailed mind maps designed to assist learners, educators, and self-studiers in the field of Quantum Computing:

**Quantum Computing Resources**
A curated visual collection of essential learning materials, including lecture notes, textbooks, video lectures, online courses, and tutorials, all organized into a structured format with active hyperlinks for quick and easy access.

**Quantum Computing Syllabus**
A visual course overview outlining the main topics and concepts typically covered in a foundational or intermediate quantum computing course. This is especially useful for course planning, personal study roadmaps, or onboarding new learners.

*This collection is the result of years of hands-on experience and exploration in the quantum physics and quantum computing. It goes far beyond simply asking an AI to compile a list! 😉*

*Originally created for the 2023 Stellenbosch Honours course in Quantum Computing, this resource has been continually expanded and refined over time.*
